        <h1>Control's geometry</h1>
        <h2>Control itself does not directly control its size</h2>
        <p>Instead of setting self size directly Control can announce 3 parameters per direction
            (horizontal/vertical):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Minimum size — minimum required amount of space.
                All parents must follow this value and must guarantee that Control receives not less space.
                This is the only guaranteed geometry parameter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Best size — size at which Control can draw itself in the best way.
                This parameter is just a recommendation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum size — maximum size at which Control want draw itself.
                It is not always possible to follow this restriction.
                For example if window has 2 visible Controls arranged vertically (Control A over Control B)
                and Control A minimum width larger than Control B maximum width, then both Controls must have the same
                width.
                In this case Control B receive larger width than it announce as maximum.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following restriction applies to these parameters: minimum ≤ best ≤ maximum.</p>
        <p>
            GUI geometry hypervisor (special algorithm implemented by window) takes these parameters and after
            computation sets appropriate width and height for Control.
            When Control draw itself it uses these width and height as an available region,
            but can decide (especially if region is larger than announced maximum size) to draw itself only on some part
            of available region, in center for example.
        </p>
        <h2>Width has priority over height</h2>
        <p>
            Width is a primary dimension and height is secondary dimension.
            This is because in most cases text is horizontal oriented and peoples prefer vertical scroll over
            horizontal.
            Priority of width means following: height is a function of width.
            For example, we have some long text and want to draw it, then height will depend on available width (how
            much line breaks required).
        </p>
        <h2>Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Following algorithm used to achieve “Control itself does not directly control its size” and “Width has
            priority over height” (Control's point of view):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Geometry hypervisor (GH) asks Control about minimal, best and maximum width. Control computes requested
                parameter based on what exactly and how it would draw.
            </li>
            <li>GH set Control's width (and horizontal position in window coordinates).</li>
            <li>GH asks Control about minimal, best and maximum height. Here Control can use width from previous step to
                compute requested parameters.
            </li>
            <li>GH set Control's height (and vertical position in window coordinates).</li>
            <li>GH request Control to draw. Control draw itself somewhere in region defined by step 2 & 4 of this
                algorithm.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Events</h1>
        <p>Events can be categorized by how Controls receive them:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Event</th>
                <th>Receiving</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Keyboard events<br>(press/release non-modifier key)</td>
                <td>
                    Control which is focused receives this event.<br>
                    Control must decide does it accept event or not.<br>
                    If event is not accepted by Control, then it will be sent to Control's parent (iterating up to
                    window).
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pointer button press events<br>(press mouse button)</td>
                <td rowspan="2">
                    Topmost (in term of Z index) Control under pointer receives this event.<br>
                    Control must decide does it accept event or not.<br>
                    If event is not accepted by Control then it will be sent to “less topmost” Control under pointer
                    (iterating up to window).
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Scroll event<br>(scroll mouse wheel)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pointer button other events<br>(release/click mouse button)</td>
                <td rowspan="2">
                    Control which receives (and accepts) appropriate pointer button press event receives this event.<br>
                    Event will not be sent to other Controls even if it was not accepted.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pointer drag events<br>(drag using mouse button)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Modifiers events<br>(press/release keyboard modifier key)</td>
                <td rowspan="3">All Controls which have previously subscribed to this type of events.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
